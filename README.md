This repository creates and distributes the unofficial Appimage of Gnumeric built from Debian Stable. This AppImage should work only with a GLIBC version equal or newer than the one used in Debian Stable (see `libc6` at https://packages.debian.org/stable/gnumeric).

From here you can download the scripts to build from Debian Stable and on top of [JuNest](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest), the lightweight Arch Linux based distro that runs, without root privileges, on top of any other Linux distro (I'm still working on integrating [ArchImages](https://github.com/ivan-hc/ArchImage) into the system, that's why I preferred to use Debian as a base).
